    "helpmsg": "Hi there!\nI can help you with a couple of things around emoji. Here's a list of features:\n\n<strong>1) Get the name!</strong>\nSend me an emoji and I can tell you what it's called (officially). I am also going to provide you with its <em>alpha name</em>. The alpha name of an emoji is a code to uniquely identify any emoji. It usually comes in the form <code>:alpha_name:</code>. This helps you to find the emoji quicker: once you know its alpha name, you no longer need to search for it in endless lists, just type that code and Telegram will automatically find it for you (and even replace it in the message text!). It's especially useful if you're using a computer because you no longer have to leave your keyboard during typing.\n\n<strong>2) Search!</strong>\nSimple send me any text and I'll try to find matching emoji. I'm going to have a look at all the names and alpha names. In the results, simply tap the emoji to copy it to your clipboard! You can also copy the alpha names that way. Join @alphamojibotnews to stay updated on when we'll add more search criteria (we already have some things in mind)! It's free!\n\n<strong>3) Discover!</strong>\nEver wondered whether there's different emoji for the same thing? Use me to explore new emoji and find stuff you didn't even know was out there. We're currently having 2666 emoji in our database. You'll be surprised what you'll find. We were, too.\n\n<strong>4) Bonus: Get the unicode point!</strong>\nAdmittedly, this one is for nerds (and computer programmers who don't see themselves as nerds, if there's any of those out there). Every time I send you message with an emoji, you'll also get the unicode point (or rather a series of that) with it (also free!)."
